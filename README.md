## Features

1. **Automated Savings**  
   Users can set savings schedules (daily, monthly, or yearly) and automate transfers from their wallets into dedicated savings vaults.
2. **Spend-to-Save**  
   Every time a user spends tokens, a fraction is automatically saved in their CoinSafe vault, encouraging long-term saving behavior.

3. **Synthetic Staking Rewards**  
   CoinSafe allows users to earn staking rewards on their savings without locking their tokens for long durations.

4. **Onchain Credit Score**  
   Build credit scores based on regular savings. These scores are represented by NFTs that evolve as the userâ€™s score improves.

5. **DeFi Integration**  
   Users can access decentralized financial services such as microloans, staking, and yield farming directly from their CoinSafe accounts.

6. **Transparent & Verifiable**  
   All transactions are stored onchain, ensuring transparency and traceability.

## Architecture

CoinSafe operates on the Base network, leveraging smart contracts and decentralized storage solutions. It is designed to be modular, with the following components:

- **Savings Vaults**: Smart contracts holding user funds.
- **Staking Contracts**: For synthetic rewards.
- **Credit Score NFTs**: Representing users' onchain creditworthiness.
- **Oracles**: For integrating off-chain data when needed.

## Usage

1. **Automated Savings**

   - Users can deposit into their savings vault, set a savings schedule, and view their balance and rewards through the dApp.

2. **Spend-to-Save**

   - Upon executing any transaction via the CoinSafe wallet, a fraction of the transaction will be routed into the user's savings vault automatically.

3. **Credit Score**

   - Users can monitor their credit score in real-time and mint new NFTs whenever their score improves. The NFT dynamically displays the score as an SVG.

4. **Staking**
   - Stake tokens to earn rewards. Rewards accrue based on the amount and time staked without penalization for early withdrawal.

## Credit Score System

CoinSafe introduces an innovative onchain credit score mechanism based on user savings and spending behavior.

- **Credit NFTs**: Credit scores are stored in an NFT. The NFT metadata dynamically updates the score over time.
- **Point System**: Users earn points for regular savings. The higher the points, the better the credit score. Points are recalculated periodically based on savings history.

## Technologies Used

- **Base Network**: L2 scaling solution built on Ethereum.
- **Solidity**: Smart contract language used for creating the CoinSafe contracts.
- **Hardhat**: Development environment for compiling, testing, and deploying smart contracts.
- **React**: Frontend framework for building the CoinSafe dApp.
